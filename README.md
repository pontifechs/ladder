I'd like to create a site for all of the different games played at SD. (Ping Pong, Pool, Foosball, Magic, anything!)

The site would track match history, including scores, and perhaps some notes?
I'd really like to have something for match discovery or match making.
Support for tournaments (maybe backed by challonge tournaments?)

To start with maybe just have a simple way to record matches played.

Will need to separate all matches by category probably? 
Will need to have different match types (Single match (everything), Best of X (pool, foosball), Games/Sets (ping pong?)
Will need to record the final scores for each participant
Will also need to support multi-participant (magic, pool, doubles ping/foos)
Might be nice to allow for comments from both parties.

I'm not sure it'll be necessary to deal too much with arbitration (players disagree), as all are co-workers, and more
crucially meet face to face every day.

From a UI perspective, I'd like the front page be a sort of history of the last few matches played.
Once logged in, the history would narrow to your matches, with interactions for create/edit matches.

So in short, I need to have API tier for matches, rounds?, and users complete for this first round.
Then I can go into some of the UI with react-flux-bone, etc.
